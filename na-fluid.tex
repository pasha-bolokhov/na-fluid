\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Emphasize importance of the subject}

\item {\it Insert about the non-Abelian components of the current ---
	they are non-observable anyway.
	It is imaginable that different quarks move different ways
	in the same field.
	We test the general idea of the possibility to have non-Abelian interacting fluids}
\end{itemize}

\setcounter{equation}{0}

	Consider a Lagrangian which would roughly form a generalization of the Clebsch parametrization,
\beq
\label{lagrangian}
	\ml    ~~=~~    2\, \Tr\, J_\mu\,  \md^{\text{A}\mu} \theta   ~~-~~  f(n)  ~~+~~
			\frac{1}{2}\, \Tr\, G_{\mu\nu}^2\,.
\eeq
	Here,
\beq
	J_\mu    ~~=~~    J_\mu^a\, T^a
\eeq
	is the non-Abelian current,
\beq
	\md^\text{A}_\mu    ~~=~~    \p_\mu  ~~+~~  [ A_\mu\,, \cdot\,\, ]
\eeq
	is the gauge derivative in the adjoint representation,
\beq
	\theta    ~~=~~    \theta^a\, T^a
\eeq
	is the analogue of the Clebsch potential,
\beq
	f(n)\,, \qquad\qquad n ~=~ \sqrt{ J_\mu^a\, J^{\mu a} }
\eeq
	is a function determining the dynamics of the fluid (interactions and so on),
	and
\beq
	G_{\mu\nu}    ~~=~~    \p_{[\mu} A_{\nu]}  ~~+~~ [ A_\mu\, A_\nu ]
\eeq
	is the gluon field strength.
%%	The derivative in square brackets $ [\, \md^\mu\, \underline{~~}\, ] $ is just a derivative
%%	acting in the adjoint representation.

	Unlike QED, where the current is gauge invariant, in a non-Abelian theory, both $ J_\mu $
	and $ \theta $ must transform as adjoints of SU($N$).

	The equations of motion for Eq.~\eqref{lagrangian} are
\begin{align}
%
\label{cconserv}
	\md^\text{A}_\mu\, J^\mu     & ~~=~~    0\,,
	\\[3.4mm]
%
\label{maxwell}
	\md^\text{A}_\mu\, G^{\mu\nu}     & ~~=~~    [\, \theta\, J^\nu \,]\,,
	\\[2mm]
%
\label{flow}
	\md^\text{A}_\mu\, \theta     & ~~=~~    \frac{1}{n}\, f^\prime(n)\, J_\mu\,.
\end{align}
	The first equation is just the covariant conservation of the current $ J^\mu $.
	The second equation --- the Maxwell equation --- immediately implies the conservation
	of another current
\beq
\label{aconserv}
	\md^\text{A}_\mu\, \big[\, \theta\, J^\mu \,\big]    ~~=~~    0\,.
\eeq
	Although one can use the continuity equation \eqref{cconserv} here, it does not mean
	that $ \md^\text{A}_\mu\, \theta  \,=\, 0 $.
	Instead, as Eq.~\eqref{flow} shows, this gradient is proportional to the current,
        and so commutes with it.
	The current in \eqref{aconserv} is the one that the gluons actually see.
	Although it differs from the original one in \eqref{lagrangian},
	by a non-Abelian rotation $ \theta $,
	it is the one which affects the colour gauge field.


	Finally, equation \eqref{flow} determines the dynamics (flow) of the fluid.
	Let us first plug this equation into the original Lagrangian \eqref{lagrangian}, to find
\beq
	\ml    ~~=~~    n\, f^\prime(n)  ~-~  f(n)  ~+~ \frac{1}{2}\, \Tr\, G_{\mu\nu}^2\,.
\eeq
	This roughly corresponds to our vision of the starting point for the ``integrated'' action for
	hydrodynamics.


%%	Now let us take the curl of Eq.~\eqref{flow}, and contract it with $ J^\mu $,
%%\beq
%%	\big[\, J^\mu,~ \p_{[\mu} \Big( \frac{f^\prime}{n}\, J_{\nu]} \Big) \,]  ~+~
%%	\frac{f^\prime}{n}\, \big[\, J^\mu\, [\, A_{[\mu}\, J_{\nu]} \,] \,\big]    ~~=~~
%%	\big[\, J^\mu\, [\, G_{\mu\nu}\, \theta \,] \,\big] \,.
%%\eeq
%%	The left hand side should determine the Euler equation for the fluid, with the right hand side
%%	being interpreted as the non-Abelian Lorentz force acting on the current.
%%	Although an unimportant detail, by appearance this is the Lorentz force
%%	induced by either of the currents
%%	$ J^\mu $ and $ [\, \theta\, J^\mu \,] $,
%%\beq
%%	\big[\, J^\mu\, [\, G_{\mu\nu}\, \theta \,] \,\big]    ~~=~~
%%	-\, \big[\, G_{\mu\nu}\, [\, \theta\, J^\mu \,] \,\big]  ~-~
%%	    \big[\, \theta\, [\, G_{\mu\nu}\, J^\mu \,] \,\big]\,.
%%\eeq

	We now can calculate the (covariant) curl of Eq.~\eqref{flow}, to obtain
\beq
\label{curl}
	\partial_{[\mu}\, \Big( \frac{f^\prime}{n}\, J_{\nu]} \Big)  ~~+~~
	\frac{f^\prime}{n}\, \big[\, A_{[\mu}\, J_{\nu]} \,\big]    ~~=~~
	[\, G_{\mu\nu}\, \theta \,]\,.
\eeq
	As customary, we split the currents $ J_\mu^a $ into their ``lengths'' --- $ n^a $,
	and the directions --- $ u_\mu^a $,
\beq
	J_\mu    ~~=~~    n^a\, u_{\mu}^a\, T^a\,.
\eeq
	Let us contract equation \eqref{curl} with $ J_\mu^a T^a $ for a certain $ a $,
	and multiply it by $ u_\mu^a $.
	To emphasize that there is \emph{no summation} in index $ a $, we denote it as $ \slashed{a} $,
\beq
\label{uchange}
	u_\mu^\slashed a\, \p_{[\mu} \Big( \frac{f^\prime}{n}\, J_{\nu]}^\slashed a \Big)  ~~+~~
	\frac{f^\prime}{n}\, f^{\slashed a b c}\, u_\mu^\slashed a\, A_{[\mu}^b\, J_{\nu]}^c    ~~=~~
	f^{\slashed a b c}\, u_\mu^\slashed a\, G_{\mu\nu}^b\, \theta^c\,.
\eeq
	The first term is supposed to give the change of the current $ u_\mu^a $,
	the second term is non-Abelian in nature, while the third term has the appearance of the Lorentz force.

	To check, we find the non-relativistic limit of Eq.~\eqref{uchange}, $ u^\mu ~\approx~ (\,1,~ \vec{v}\,) $,
\beq
	\p_0\, v_k^\slashed a  ~+~  (\vec{v}{}^\slashed{a}\, \vec{\p})\, v_k^\slashed a    \,~=~\,
	-\, \p_k\, L^\slashed{a}  ~-~  \frac{1}{(n^\slashed{a})^2}\, f^{\slashed a b c}\, J_\mu^\slashed{a}\, J_{[\mu}^b\, A_{k]}^c  ~+~
	\frac{1}{f^\prime / n\, (n^{\slashed a})^2}\, f^{\slashed a b c}\, J_\mu^\slashed{a}\, G_{\mu k}^b\, \theta^c\,,
\eeq
	where
\beq
	L^\slashed{a}    ~~=~~    \ln\, \Big( \frac{f^\prime}{n}\, n^\slashed{a} \Big)
\eeq
	gives the force resulting from the internal dynamics.
	The last term indeed has the form of the Lorentz force acting on the current $ [\, \theta\, J^\mu \,] $.

	We now comment on the fact that although Lagrangian \eqref{lagrangian} does indeed involve Clebsch parametrization
	of a vector field, it is not expressed in terms of potential $ \theta $.
	Instead, it is written as a Legendre transformation from variables $ J^\mu $ to $ \theta $.
	In order to re-write the Lagrangian purely in terms of $ \theta $, one needs to exclude $ J^\mu $ via
	Eq.~\eqref{flow}.
	This process, however, is not straightforward because function $ f^\prime(n) $ in the RHS of the latter equation
	itself depends on $ J^\mu $.

	\emph{There is one observation that helps}

	In general, we expect therefore that the Lagrangian is an arbitrary function --- which we call pressure ---
	of the combination $ \sqrt{ (\md^\text{A}_\mu\, \theta)^2 } $,
\beq
	\ml    ~~=~~    p\Big(\sqrt{(\md^\text{A}_\mu \theta)^2}\Big)  ~+~ \frac{1}{2}\, \Tr\, G_{\mu\nu}^2\,.
\eeq

\subsection{Energy-Momentum Tensor}
	Let us calculate the energy-momentum tensor of the Chromohydrodynamic (CHD) part of Lagrangian \eqref{lagrangian}.
	In a gauge theory it is easier to vary with respect to metric $ g^{\mu\nu} $ rather than obtaining
	a symmetric canonical energy-momentum tensor.

	One has to also take into account that $ f(n) $ also depends on the metric via $ n $.
	We find,
\beq
\label{emtensor}
	T_{\mu\nu}    ~~=~~
				\frac{(n^a)^2}{n^2}\, n f^\prime \cdot u_\mu^a u_\nu^a  ~~-~~
				g^{\mu\nu}\, \big(\, n f^\prime ~-~ f(n) \,\big)\,.
\eeq
	We observe that we have a single common pressure
\beq
	p    ~~=~~    n f^\prime(n) ~-~ f(n)
\eeq
	and $ N^2 - 1 $ energy densities
\beq
	\rho^a    ~~=~~    \lgr \Big( \frac{n^a}{n} \Big)^2 ~-~ 1 \rgr n f^\prime  ~~+~~ f(n)
\eeq
	which sum up to $ f(n) $.

        We can go further than Eq.~\eqref{lagrangian} and declare that the Lagrangian
        is a generic function of $ n $ and of the non-Abelian field strength $ \varphi^2 $,
\beq
\label{generic}
        \ml    ~~=~~    2\, \Tr\, J_\mu\,  \md^{\text{A}\mu} \theta   ~~-~~  f(n, \varphi^2)\,,
\eeq
        where
\beq
        \varphi^2    ~~=~~    \Tr\, G_{\mu\nu}^2\,.
\eeq
	The expression in Eq.~\eqref{emtensor} still gives the contribution of the current to the energy-momentum tensor.
	The overall expression that includes the contributions of both gluons and the current is
\begin{align}
%%
\notag
	T_{\mu\nu}^\text{CHD}   & 
			~~=~~
				2\, \frac{(n^a)^2}{n^2}\, n^2 f_{n^2}^\prime\, u_\mu^a u_\nu^a  ~~-~~
				4\, f_{\varphi^2}^\prime\, \Tr\, G^{\mu\lambda} G^{\nu\lambda}  ~~-~~
	\\[2mm]
%%
\label{TCHD}
	& 
			~~-~~
				g^{\mu\nu} \lgr 2\, n^2\, f_{n^2}^\prime  ~+~  2\, \varphi^2\, f_{\varphi^2}^\prime  ~-~  f \rgr .
\end{align}

\section{Scalar variables}

	Now let us express the gauge field and the current in terms of scalar variables $ X^a $, $ Y^a $, $ Z^a $.
\beq
\label{defA}
        A_\mu    ~~=~~    X^a\, \p_\mu Y^a\, \cdot\, T^a\,,
\eeq
	and, correspondingly, the field strength is
\beq
\label{defG}
	G_{\mu\nu}    ~~=~~    \md_{[\mu}\, \md_{\nu]}\,.
\eeq
	In terms of the scalars, the field strength is
\beq
\label{Ga}
	G{}_{\mu\nu}^a    ~~=~~    \p_{[\mu} X^a\, \p_{\nu]} Y^a  ~~+~~
				   f^{abc}\, X^b\, X^c\, \p_\mu Y^b\, \p_\nu Y^c\,.
\eeq
        Notice we have not introduced the coupling constant $ g $ yet, for simplicity of calculations.
	When needed, it is introduced simply by rescaling $ A_\mu ~\to~ g\, A_\mu $.
	The field strength will have to be divided by one power of $ g $ at the same time.
	But that will be done later.
        We do not treat $ X $ and $ Y $ as matrices separately, instead their combination \eqref{defA} is a matrix.
	In particular, variables $ X $ and $ Y $ do not possess well-defined gauge transformation properties.
	Instead, we treat \eqref{defA} as a particular \emph{gauge}, and thus
	$ X $ and $ Y $ do not transform by definition.

	Despite the non-Abelian nature of the plasma, we intend on constructing an Abelian current.
        This in part reflects the presence of an Abelian current in [{\it Jackiw}], via the non-Abelian Eckart decomposition [{\it Eckart}].
	More generally, [{\it Jackiw}] indicates the presence of Abelian currents residing in the Cartan subalgebra.

	Another way of looking at such an Abelian current is as follows.
	In a QCD plasma it is not possible to introduce the number density, because quarks of all sorts
	mix and match.
	If, however, the interactions are temporarily switched off, one would find a number of non-interacting fluids.
	Although this is an unphysical situation, we \emph{define} the current as the quantity which would
        become the number density current in the non-interacting limit.
	In the normal, interacting regime this current, very vaguely, describes the number density
	of both quarks and gluons of a particular colour
	(of course taking into account the fact that gluons carry the ``adjoint'' colour).

	We define
\beq
\label{defna}
	n^{\mu a}    ~~=~~    \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, \p_\nu X^\slashed{a}\, \p_\rho Y^\slashed{a}\, \p_\sigma Z^\slashed{a}\,,
\eeq
	where $ Z^a $ is a set of $ N^2 - 1 $ variables.
	This current is explicitly conserved
\beq
\label{ncont}
	\p_\mu\, n^{\mu a}    ~~=~~    0\,.
\eeq
	This approach is quite generic, in the sense that it allows for regimes where the number of Abelian
	currents reduces.
	In particular, it does not exclude scenarios in which there is just one or $ N - 1 $ Abelian currents.
	These can be found as regimes in which some or all of the ``colour'' components of $ n^{\mu a} $ line up.

	The Lagrangian can now be defined as a generic function of the ``invariant number density'' of this current
\beq
	\mc{L}    ~~=~~    \mc{L}(n^2)\,,
        \qquad\qquad
        n^2 ~~=~~ n_\mu^a\, n^{\mu a}\,.
\eeq

	It is important to recognize that \eqref{defna} is \emph{not} a chromomagnetic current,
        because the latter one would only be conserved covariantly.
	We are not specifically concerned about the expression for the chromomagnetic current.
	Its form can be found from the Maxwell equation
\beq
	\md^\text{A}_\mu\, G^{\mu\nu}     ~~=~~    j^\nu\,.
\eeq

\subsection{Tree-level energy momentum tensor}
	In the Abelian plasma, the field strength $ F^{\mu\nu} $ happens to be a bivector,
	which helps a lot in understanding the structure of the energy-momentum tensor.
	In our case, the field strength \eqref{Ga} obviously is not a bivector, but
	if we make a perturbative expansion, we can treat it as such.
	
	In order to make a perturbative expansion, one normally redefines $ A^\mu ~\to~ g A^\mu $
	while at the same time $ G^{\mu\nu} ~\to~ g^{-1} G^{\mu\nu} $.
	We prefer not to do this explicitly, while keeping in mind that each additional power of $ X $ or $ Y $
	carries an extra power of the coupling constant.

	Then the "tree-level" field strength happens to be a bivector,
\beq
	G_{\mu\nu}^{(0)a}    ~~=~~    \p_{[\mu} X^a\, \p_{\nu]} Y^a\,,
\eeq
	and can be treated the same way as in the Abelian plasma.
	Explicitly, the dual field strength is defined to be
\beq
	\wt{G}{}_{\mu\nu}^{(0)a}    ~~=~~    \phi^\slashed{a}\, w^{\slashed{a}[\rho}\, u^{\sigma]\slashed{a}},
\eeq
	where
\beq
	w^{\slashed{a}\mu}\, w^{\slashed{a}}_\mu    ~~=~~    \mp\,1\,
\eeq
	(the upper sign is for Euclidean and the lower sign for Minkowski spaces correspondingly),
	and
\beq
	( \varphi^\slashed{a} )^2    ~~=~~    \frac{1}{2}\, \big( \p_{[\mu} X^\slashed{a}\, \p_{\nu]} Y^\slashed{a} \big)^2\,.
\eeq

	With these definitions the field strength \eqref{Ga} can be re-written as
\beq
\label{G-pert}
	G_{\mu\nu}^\slashed a    ~~=~~    \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, \phi^\slashed{a} \cdot w^{a\rho}\, u^{a\sigma}
				 ~~+~~  ( f^{abc}\, A^b\, A^c )\, q_\mu^b\, q_\nu^c\,.
\eeq
	We have also introduced here a unit vector $ q^a_\mu $ directed along potential $ A_\mu^a $,
\beq
	A_\mu^a    ~~=~~    X^\slashed a\, \p_\mu Y^\slashed a    ~~\equiv~~    A^\slashed a \cdot q_\mu^\slashed a\,,
	\qquad\qquad
	( q_\mu^\slashed a )^2    ~~=~~    1\,.
\eeq
	The expansion in the coupling constant $ g $ will correspond to an expansion in the (even) powers of $ q_\mu^a $.

	Using expansion \eqref{G-pert} we find
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	T_\text{gluon}^{\mu\nu}    & ~~=~~    \frac{f^\prime_\varphi}{\varphi}\, (\varphi^a)^2\,
					      \lgr \pm\, w^{a\mu}\, w^{a\nu}  ~+~  u^{a\mu}\, u^{a\nu} \rgr    ~~-~~
	\\[2mm]
%
\label{full-tensor}
				   & ~~-~~  \frac{f^\prime_\varphi}{\varphi}\, \varphi^a\,
					    Q^{abc}_{\underline{\mu}\lambda}\, q^b_{\underline{\nu}}\, q^c_\lambda
				     ~~-~~  \frac{f^\prime_\varphi}{\varphi}\,
					    R^{abcd}\, ( q^a_\kappa\, q^c_\kappa )\, q^b_\mu\, q^d_\nu    ~~-~~
	\\[2mm]
%
\notag
				   & ~~-~~  g^{\mu\nu}
					    \lgr \frac{f^\prime_\varphi}{\varphi}\, (\varphi^a)^2  ~-~  f \rgr .
\end{align}
	Here the underlined subscripts $ \underline{\mu} $ and $ \underline{\nu} $ assume symmetrization
	in these indices.
	The coefficients $ Q^{abc}_{\mu\nu} $ and $ R^{abcd} $ are defined as
\begin{align*}
%
	Q^{abc}_{\mu\nu}    & ~~=~~    \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,
				       f^{\slashed a\slashed b\slashed c}\, A^\slashed{b}\, A^\slashed{c}\,
				       w^{a\rho}\, u^{a\sigma}\,,
	\\[2mm]
%
	R^{abcd}    & ~~=~~    f^{f\slashed a\slashed b}\, A^\slashed{a}\, A^\slashed{b} \cdot
			       f^{f\slashed c\slashed d}\, A^\slashed{c}\, A^\slashed{d}\,.
\end{align*}
	Tensor \eqref{full-tensor} is a complete expression for the energy-momentum tensor,
	even though it does have the appearance of an expansion in powers of $ q^a_\mu $.

	To obtain a true expansion in powers of the coupling constant, we observe that the flux $ \varphi $
	needs to be expanded beforehand,
\beq
	\varphi^2    ~~=~~    (\varphi^a)^2  ~~+~~ \varphi^a\, Q^{abc}_{\kappa\lambda}\, q^b_\kappa\, q^c_\lambda
		     ~~+~~ \frac 1 2\, R^{abcd}\, (q^a_\kappa\, q^c_\kappa)\, (q^b_\lambda\, q^d_\lambda)\,.
\eeq
	Substituting this, we obtain the leading order contribution to the gluon energy-momentum tensor,
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	T_\text{gluon}^{\mu\nu}    & ~~=~~    2\, f^\prime_{\varphi^2} \bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}}\,
					      (\varphi^a)^2 \lgr \pm\, w^{a\mu}\, w^{a\nu}  ~+~  u^{a\mu}\, u^{a\nu} \rgr
				     ~~-~~
	\\[1mm]
%
\label{tree-tensor}
				   & ~~-~~    g^{\mu\nu} \lgr 2\, f^\prime_{\varphi^2}\, \varphi^2 ~-~ f \rgr \bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}}
				     ~~+~~    O\big(\, q^2 \,\big)\,.
\end{align}
	Here we have denoted the "tree-level" $ \varphi $ as $ \varphi_{(0)} $\,
\beq
	\varphi_{(0)}    ~~=~~    \sqrt{ (\varphi^a)^2 }\,.
\eeq
	We can imagine that this hydrodynamic limit is reached in the regime of a very weak coupling.
	The corrections to \eqref{tree-tensor} are easily found
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	\Delta T_\text{gluon}^{\mu\nu}    & ~~=~~    2\, f''_{\varphi^2}\bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}} \cdot
						     \varphi^b\, Q^{bcd}_{\kappa\lambda}\, q^c_\kappa q^d_\lambda \cdot
						     (\varphi^a)^2
						     \lgr \pm\, w^{a\mu}\, w^{a\nu} ~+~ u^{a\mu}\, u^{a\nu} ~-~ g^{\mu\nu} \rgr
					    ~~-~~
	\\[1mm]
%
\label{tensor-corr}
					  & ~~-~~    2\, f''_{\varphi^2}\bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}} \cdot
						     \varphi^a\, Q^{abc}_{\underline{\mu}\lambda}\, q^b_{\underline \nu}\, q^c_\lambda
					    ~~+~~ O\big(\, q^4 \,\big)\,.
\end{align}
	Again, here the upper sign of $ \pm $ corresponds to Euclidean space, and the lower sign to Minkowski space.

	Equation \eqref{tree-tensor} can now be complemented with the contribution of the Abelian currents \eqref{defna}.
	Now we assume that the Lagrangian is a generic function of $ n^2 $ and $ \varphi^2 $,
\beq
	\mc{L}    ~~=~~    -\, f( n^2, \varphi^2 )\,.
\eeq
	Taking into account the fact that \eqref{defna} is a pseudo-vector, the overall energy-momentum tensor reads,
\begin{align}
%
\notag
	T_\text{gluon}^{\mu\nu}    &
					~~=~~
						\bigl\lgroup 2\, f_{n^2}^\prime (n^a)^2  ~+~
        					2\, f^\prime_{\varphi^2} \bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}}\, (\varphi^a)^2 \bigr\rgroup
						u^{a\mu}\, u^{a\nu}
					~~\pm~~
	\\[2mm]
%
\label{Ttotal}
	&
					~~\pm~~
						2\, f^\prime_{\varphi^2} \bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}}\, (\varphi^a)^2\, w^{a\mu}\, w^{a\nu}
					~~-~~
	\\[2mm]
%
\notag
	& 
					~~-~~
					g^{\mu\nu} \lgr
						2\, f_{n^2}^\prime n^2 ~+~ 2\, f^\prime_{\varphi^2}\, \varphi^2
						~-~ f
					\rgr \bigg|_{\varphi_{(0)}}
					~~+~~
					O\big(\, q^2 \,\big)\,.
\end{align}
	Notably, expression \eqref{Ttotal} has the same form as \eqref{TCHD} --- except for the presence
	of the anisotropic term due to $ w^{a\mu} $, and for a more specific form of $ G_{\mu\nu}^a $
	in terms of $ u^{\mu a} $.
